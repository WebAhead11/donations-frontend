## WEEK10-12 project by Aziz , Tawfeek and Amal
we used react in this project

our project idea is about the Donations and helping others,
our website basiclly allows you to see things that other people dont need anymore and posted them so other people can benefit from them such as used devices ,used clothes furnitures etc..
---
everyone can use our website and to access the things that other people put for donation but in order to share something that you want to donate you have to sign in 
with your email.
